# Nova Angular Talks

Want to speak at [NovaAngular](https://www.meetup.com/Nova-Angular/)? We'd love to have you! Finding great speakers is one of the most difficult parts about running a meetup and we **love** when folks volunteer.

We really appreciate your effort! We're looking for any technical talks relating to Angular 2+.

Once you have a topic in mind, go ahead and fill out a talk request using [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/melxx001/novaangular/issues/new). There is a template built in, please fill out as much as you know. We'll review the topic and ask any questions in the comments on that issue. Once the idea is ready to go, we'll get it on the schedule and work with you to prepare!

## Contacting Us

If you'd like to submit a talk idea, please create a [new GitHub issue](https://github.com/melxx001/novaangular/issues/new)!
